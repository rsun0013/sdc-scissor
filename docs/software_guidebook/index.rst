Software Guidebook
==================
This is the start of the software guidebook of SDC-Scissor; a cost-effective test selector for simulation-based tests
in self-driving cars software. It includes a summary of the following:

* The requirements, constraints and principles behind SDC-Scissor.
* The software architecture, including the high-level technology choices and structure of the software.
* The infrastructure architecture and how the software is deployed.
* Operational and support aspects of the website.

This book is based upon the concept of a software guidebook as described in
`Software Architecture for Developers <https://leanpub.com/software-architecture-for-developers>`_ book. The book is
structured as follows:
